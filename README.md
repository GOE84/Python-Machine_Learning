# 🤖 Python Machine Learning Playground

> **"Learning is a treasure that will follow its owner everywhere."**

Welcome! 👋 This repository is a curated collection of my experiments, studies, and notes related to **Machine Learning**, **Data Science**, and **AI**.

I created this repo to document my learning journey and to keep useful code snippets for future reference.

## 📂 What's Inside?
Here is a list of topics I am currently exploring:

### 1. Data Processing & Mathematics
- **[Numpy.ipynb](./Numpy.ipynb)**: Matrix operations, linear algebra, and array manipulation basics.
- *(Coming Soon)*: Pandas dataframes & Data Cleaning techniques.

### 2. Machine Learning Models
- *(Future)*: Linear Regression / Classification examples.
- *(Future)*: Neural Networks basics using TensorFlow/PyTorch.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 🐍
- **Environment:** Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
- **Core Libraries:**
  - `NumPy` - Numerical computing
  - `Pandas` - Data manipulation
  - `Matplotlib/Seaborn` - Data visualization
  - `Scikit-learn` - Classic ML algorithms

## 🚀 How to Use
Feel free to browse through the notebooks (`.ipynb` files) to see my coding implementations.
